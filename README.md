# Capstone Project - Front end

<h3><u>Concept</u></h3>
A web application that will allow you to order food from your local restaurants, cafes and takeaways.
<br><br>
There will be types of accounts: Customer and Restaurant Owner.

- Users will be able to choose which sort of food they would like to order with the capability to search, sort and filter restaurants. Once a user has decided, they will be able to view the menu and choose items to add to their order. Once they have decided, they will be taken through the order and payment process.

- Restaurant owners will be able to login and manage their menus. Add, remove, edit items aswell as set stock levels that will adjust when a customer orders. They will be able to view a history of orders they have recieved. In a real world setting, the owner would be logged in while their restaurant is open and they would recieve notifications of when an order has been placed. They would then be able to accept / decline an order with the information fedback to the customer live.
